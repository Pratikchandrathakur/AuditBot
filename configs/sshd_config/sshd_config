# This is the sshd server system-wide configuration file.  See
# sshd_config(5) for more information.

# This sshd was compiled with PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games

# The strategy used for options in the default sshd_config shipped with
# OpenSSH is to specify options with their default value where
# possible, but leave them commented.  Uncommented options override the
# default value.

Include /etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/*.conf

# When systemd socket activation is used (the default), the socket
# configuration must be re-generated after changing Port, AddressFamily, or
# ListenAddress.
#
# For changes to take effect, run:
#
#   systemctl daemon-reload
#   systemctl restart ssh.socket
#
#Port 22
#AddressFamily any
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
#ListenAddress ::
